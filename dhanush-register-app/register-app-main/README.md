# Dhanush Register App

A modified version of an open-source registration app, adapted and customized by **Dhanush Guntumadugu** for learning and demonstration purposes.

> **Important — license & attribution:** This project was originally forked from an existing repository. Make sure to check the original repository's license and comply with its terms (some licenses require attribution or forbids claiming sole authorship). I have added a `LICENSE_COPY_NOTICE.txt` file in the project root with guidance.

## What I changed
- Renamed project to **dhanush-register-app** and updated package metadata.
- Updated visible app title and some identifiers to personalize the project.
- Added this README and a license notice file.
- Minor UI text and comment edits to make the project feel like a personal fork.

## Quick run (typical for Node / React apps)
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
3. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

If the project uses a different framework (Express, Flask, plain HTML), check `package.json` and the project root for instructions.

## How to publish this repo on GitHub (step-by-step)
See `PUBLISHING_STEPS.md` in the project root for a step-by-step guide tailored for beginners.

## Notes
- Keep the original LICENSE file (if present) and follow its rules.
- If you want, I can further: add new features, change styling, or write unit tests.
